<!-- we have a value attribute because when the button submits the form, the value of petchoice will be set to on. that is what is returned by default, saying something has been selected. -->

<!-- lets make a select tag or dropdown menue. this will have some options to select. each option will return a value specified by us. and it would assign this val to the name given to the select tag -->
<p>how are you feeling?</p>
